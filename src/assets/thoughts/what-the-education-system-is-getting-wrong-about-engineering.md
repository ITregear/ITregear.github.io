### Built for Oceans

While most children were immersed in *Harry Potter*, I was captivated by two rather different titles: [*The Collins Field Guide to Sharks*](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780007136100/Collins-Field-Guide-Sharks-Compagno-0007136102/plp) and [*507 Mechanical Movements*](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/507-Mechanical-Movements-Brown-Henry-Martino/31840392726/bd). In hindsight, I was either destined for engineering or quite a strange nine-year-old (or both!).

I was intrigued by the gears, especially seeing the real implementations in [the Science Museum](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/energy-hall). But the sharks always kept my fascination, especially one sad but alluring fact; *Great White Sharks cannot be kept alive in captivity*, and [not for lack of trying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Bay_Aquarium#Great_white_sharks).

They can’t breathe unless they’re constantly swimming. It’s called obligate ram ventilation. In tanks, they spiral: crashing into walls, refusing food, disoriented until stress or injury takes over. They don’t die because they are weak. They die because they were not built for artificial limits.

### Design, Make, Test

Engineering education still largely adheres to a waterfall model: sequentially design, build, test and success (hopefully). It’s a framework that assumes a linear world. One that rewards sticking-to-a-plan over resilience or flexibility. Where polish often trumps practicality, and paper success can compensate for real-world failure.

But genuine engineering is not linear. It is iterative, improvisational, alive. You build something bad on Monday so it might work by Thursday. The best teams do not avoid failure; they seek it out.

At Imperial, our third-year *Design, Make, Test* module aims to reflect this reality. We had a team, a brief, and months of design work: detailed reports, rigorous material selection, two design gateways and a fixation on perfection in CAD, all before prototyping anything.

And we made. And we tested. And it didn’t work.

We were told we couldn't use nylon, “because it outgasses in space.” But we weren’t going to space. We were building a Mars Rover that would drive on a patch of grass. We were being trained to operate within imaginary constraints, in a risk-free world where as long as theoretical specs were hit, surely the real product would function flawlessly.

To be clear, this is not a criticism of Imperial. *Design, Make, Test* is among the strongest programmes of its kind, and my favourite module at uni. The faculty are world-class and passionately supportive. But even there, at one of the finest institutions in the world, it sometimes felt as though we were still swimming in an artificial pool.

Because this isn’t about one module. It’s about a deeper issue: an educational operating system that prizes polish over progress, and caution over creativity. One that teaches young engineers to plan for perfection rather than thrive in ambiguity.

### From Tank to Table


When I joined KAIKAKU, a food robotics startup, I had 69 days to deliver a working system, not polished presentations, a perfect PDS (Product Design Specification) or a promising plan.

I printed parts overnight. Tested in the morning. No time for simulation or even hand-calculations. Completely ignored all shaft constraint advice from my course - there just wasn't time. I didn't even write down a detailed PDS. I worked by a single spec:

> The robot must be able to serve salad in a bowl.

Not a single of the hundreds of small tweaks and iterations fully worked before the day, but progress was consistent and relentless. There genuinely wasn't even time for a single test - [the first ever salad popped out of the machine](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kaikaku-ai_food-automation-robotics-activity-7140013621484376064-TfC1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAC1G3K4BSqrIAQ2QW8kg8pYLtuUxVFChlns) in front of our live audience - and went to my Mum.

That robot wouldn’t exist if I’d followed the university playbook. One professor once told me, *“3D printing isn’t real engineering.”* At KAIKAKU, it’s the only reason anything worked at all.

### Stepping Out of the Pool

> The answer isn’t just learning to swim better, it’s redesigning the water we’re teaching students in.

If you want to get started building, but feel like the typical engineering workflow is looming and slow:

- 3D printers are cheap. [Get one](https://uk.store.bambulab.com/collections/3d-printer).
- There is a time and place for simulation. A surprising amount can be learned by just doing and seeing what happens.
- There are only so many ways something can fail. [If you find them all, it has to work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis).
- Aim to seek out failure. 
- Be realistic. Perfection is the enemy of progress. Aim for *anything* that works before you worry about the details.

If you’re shaping an engineering curriculum:

- Encourage more than a single prototype or redesign. Product design should be live and fluid.
- Integrate rapid prototyping into the curriculum.
- Treat CAD as a tool, not a deliverable.
- Reward early failure (as long as identified lessons are learned).

The best engineers aren’t the ones who perfectly replicate their original Gantt chart. They’re the ones who adapt when the plan changes. And if we keep training them in tanks, carefully controlled, imaginary environments, **we’ll keep producing graduates who can explain failure, but not overcome it**.

And like the great white shark, capable but dying in captivity, we risk losing brilliant engineers to the limits we impose on their learning.
