        <h1>Engineering Manifesto</h1>
        <ol class="manifesto-list">
            <li>
                <p class="manifesto-point"><strong>Engineer like a scientist</strong></p>
                <p class="manifesto-quote">Always question your own hypotheses. Prototypes should be made to prove that your ideas don’t work. Only when you <em>can’t</em> break them, or find flaws, have you found a jackpot.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="manifesto-point"><strong>Never fall victim to sunk cost fallacy</strong></p>
                <p class="manifesto-quote">Learn to realise when to change course, even if it means completely changing direction. Incomplete work isn’t a loss, it's a lesson. Learn when not to persevere.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="manifesto-point"><strong>Fundamentals are key</strong></p>
                <p class="manifesto-quote">The tried and tested way correctly implemented is far more successful and useful than a new idea that fails to achieve results.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="manifesto-point"><strong>Broaden your engineering horizon</strong></p>
                <p class="manifesto-quote">It’s important to have a specialism, but the best engineers take inspirations from all aspects of the field; mechanical design, electronics, software, information theory, maths.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="manifesto-point"><strong>Don’t waste time on ‘cool features’</strong></p>
                <p class="manifesto-quote">Save these for your hobbyist projects. For a project to succeed you need to be honest with yourself and strictly work on only what genuinely adds value.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="manifesto-point"><strong>An inventor should always be willing to use their own product</strong></p>
                <p class="manifesto-quote">Drive the car you work on. Clean the machine you’ve designed. You’ll never know what aspects truly need your attention unless you’ve had to suffer at the hands of your own oversights. Get off your desk.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="manifesto-point"><strong>Prototype as fast as you can</strong></p>
                <p class="manifesto-quote">The rate of success is directly proportional to your rate of iteration. You should be testing, failing, and retrying several times a day. If your workflow requires weeks to receive feedback, change it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="manifesto-point"><strong>No future-proofing</strong></p>
                <p class="manifesto-quote">There’s no point in imagining all the ways your product might not work, waste time trying to mitigate them, when you might never even get there. Wait for success, and <em>then</em> play catch-up.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
